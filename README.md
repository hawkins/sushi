# 🍣 sushi 🍥

Using neural networks to determine if a combination of ingredients will make for a tasty sushi roll

🥕 🥗 🍤 🐟 🐠 🧀

# Usage

```bash
$ npm install
# provide your own training data
$ npm start
```

# Testing

This one's a little tricky. Basically, it boils down to this:

1.  Train your net
2.  Run your predicted roll
3.  Hop on your hipster fixed-gear bicycle
4.  Pedal on down to the local grocer
5.  Pick up all the ingredients
6.  Pedal back to your downtown loft overlooking the Apple store
7.  Make the roll
8.  Remember to Tweet before you Eat
9.  Eat like you've never eaten before
10. Tell your net if it tasted good

Rinse, repeat

If you're lame to have fun, just run these shell commands:

```bash
$ npm it # oh would you look at that, it's just one shell command, look at all this time I saved you so you can actually go make the damn sushi roll
```

###### P.S.

> This is a dumb joke, but I like sushi, so I'm taking my own stupid computer-generated advice whenever I order sushi. Your tastebuds may vary.
